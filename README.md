Description of the Fibonacci Sequence
  - a list of numbers where the next number is the sum of the two nunbers before it

The difference in the loop and Recursion Model
  *LOOP
    - using 0 and 1 to start off ( a=0 b=1 c=0)

   *Recursion
     - uses f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 1

The Big O Notation for this algorithm and how you arrive at that conclusion
  -The loop is O(n) because it itterates through and entire array. The function iterates "n" 

  -The Recursion is O(2^n) because the function makes two recursive calls which causes an exponential growth in the number of calls.

  The Recursive approach is less effective because of the exponetial time complexity
